# YOLOv8 Face Detection Project Dependencies
# Generated for Python 3.8+ environment

# IMPORTANT: Ensure PyTorch wheels are discoverable by pip (Windows/Linux)
# Using the official PyTorch wheel index (CUDA 12.1 build). This also works on CPU-only machines.
# For strictly CPU builds, you can override this with:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Core Deep Learning Framework (versions aligned)
# Note: torchvision 0.20.x pairs with torch 2.5.x; torchaudio 2.5.x as well.
# PyTorch 2.5 requires Python >= 3.9. Provide a Python 3.8 fallback.
# Python >= 3.9
torch>=2.5.1; python_version >= "3.9"
torchvision>=0.20.1; python_version >= "3.9"
torchaudio>=2.5.1; python_version >= "3.9"
# Python 3.8 fallback (aligned versions)
torch==2.2.*; python_version == "3.8"
torchvision==0.17.*; python_version == "3.8"
torchaudio==2.2.*; python_version == "3.8"

# Computer Vision
opencv-python>=4.10.0
# If you rely on the vendored `ultralytics/` in this repo, this dependency is optional.
# Keeping it here is generally safe, but you can remove it to avoid potential conflicts.
ultralytics>=8.1.0

# Scientific Computing
numpy>=1.24.3
scipy>=1.10.1

# Data Processing and Visualization
pandas>=2.0.3
matplotlib>=3.7.5
seaborn>=0.13.2

# Machine Learning
scikit-learn>=1.3.2

# Image Processing
Pillow>=10.4.0

# Progress Bars
tqdm>=4.66.5

# Utilities
pyyaml>=6.0.2
requests>=2.32.3

# # Configuration and Data Classes
# dataclasses; python_version < "3.7"  # Built-in for Python 3.7+

# Development and Testing (optional)
pytest>=8.3.3

# GPU Support (if using CUDA)
# Note: CUDA runtime/toolkit is not installed via this file. PyTorch wheels with "cu121"
# include the necessary runtime. Do NOT install "pytorch-cuda" via pip here (conda-only meta pkg).
